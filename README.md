pyKLIP is an open-source python library for direct imaging exoplanets and disks. For more information visit https://pyklip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/# 

Our wrapper provides an easy way of running pyKLIP on MagAO data. The MasterKLIP.sh script launches a GUI to simplify parameter selection, and runs either a single pyKLIP reduction or a series of reductions with varying parameters. The latter option outputs a map of pyKLIP's parameter space, showing which combinations of parameters result in the highest signal to noise detections for a given object. 

Developed by Clare Leonard, Elijah Spiro, and Kate Follette.
